# Algorithm for Tracking Convective Systems (ATRACKCS)

## Introduction

ATRACKCS is a Python package for the automated detection and tracking of Mesoscale convective systems (MCS). MCS are organized cloud clusters that produce regional rainfall and feature vertical development penetrating the mid-upper troposphere. The spatio-temporal characterization of MCS plays a fundamental role in understanding weather and regional climate, and contributes to reducing the vulnerability to severe precipitation events. This Python package is a potential tool for characterizing spatio-temporal distribution and evolution of MCS and is intended for researchers and students interested in exploring MCS dynamics. 

ATRACKCS provides a set of functions designed for a workflow analysis that includes the detection and characterization of MCS, as well as the integration in tracks, allowing detailed monitoring of the MCS life cycle both in space and time. The algorithm uses brightness temperature (Tb) and precipitation (P) coming from public satellite data and can operate with Tb as the only input variable or associating precipitation features. The algorithm parameterization can be adapted to the needs of the MCS detection, as the user is allowed to define the thresholds of Tb and P. 

### Technical details and Usage 

The MCS (regions) detection and characterization are performed using these steps: 

1. The input data: Tb and P area processed. The algorithm can operate with Tb as the only input variable. At a given time step, the algorithm finds all pixels where `Tb <= Tb_threshold [200 k - 240 k]` and defines approximate regions with the convex hull, using a binary structure where the pixels that satisfy the described condition are equal to 1 and the remaining pixels are equal to 0. 
2. Transform from geographic to plane coordinates and compute an approximate area of the defined region, discard all regions where area is `<= area_threshold [>= 1000 km**2]` and estimate Tb attributes of those regions.
3. Estimate P attributes of those regions and discard regions based on P rate and P area containing. This is optional.

The tracks are performed using these steps:

4. overlapping priority principle: for any MCS at time t, the MCS with the highest overlap percentage at time `t+1` "wins" and is associated with it. The MCS (with lower or no overlap percentages) at time `t+1`could form a track on their own, and are left to be associated in the next iteration between `t+1` and `t+2`.
No merging or splitting is allowed, any MCS at time t can only be linked to one MCS at time `t+1`. Similarly, any MCS at time `t+1` can only be linked to one MCS at time `t`. All tracks that do not get updated during the `t` - `t+1` process terminate. 
5. Estimate MCS and tracks attributes.

The algorithm can be adapted to the needs of the MCS detection, as the user is allowed to define the thresholds of Tb and P (no required). Notebooks and scripts presenting the algorithm functionalities based on use cases are available on the repository page. 

## Input Data 

**Brightness Temperature**: NCEP/CPC L3 (Merge IR V1): Spatial and temporal resolution is 4 km and 30 minutes, data availability from February 7, 2000 to present. The interest variable of this dataset is `Tb` and the file format must be netCDF4. [Access link.](https://doi.org/10.5067/P4HZB9N27EKU/)

**Precipitation**: GPM (IMERG V06B): Spatial and temporal resolution is 0.1 degree (âˆ¼10 km) and 30 minutes, data availability from June 1, 2000 to present. The interest variable of this dataset is `PrecipitationCal` and the file format must be netCDF4. [Access link.](https://doi.org/10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH/06)

We suggest the option `subset/get data` and use `OpenDAP` method for downloading and refining the date range and interest region.

## Installation

It is recommended to build the Python environment using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Installation may take several minutes.

### Create conda environment using environment file

After Anaconda installation, git clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/alramirezca/ATRACKCS
```

Then build a new conda environment using the environment file provided. For example:

```
cd ATRACKCS
conda env create -f env_py3.yml
```

This creates a new environment named `atrackcs_py3`. Activate the environment using

```
conda activate atrackcs_py3
```

After that, you can check the list of packages installed by

```
conda list
```

Finally install ATRACKCS using:

```
pip install -e .
```
## tests

To validate installation, issue a new Python session and run

```
import atrackcs
```

If nothing prints out, installation is successful.

## Inventory

* atrackcs: core module functions.
* notebooks: a series of jupyter notebooks illustrating the major functionalities of the package.
