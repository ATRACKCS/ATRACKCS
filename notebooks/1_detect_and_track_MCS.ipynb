    "# Track Mesoescale Convective Systems (MCS) at consecutive time steps to form tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tracks detected MCS at individual time steps to form tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle for detecting the MCS is from the cold top of the clouds, according to a limiting range of brightness temperature, and an approximate horizontal area generating from the convex hull. The algorithm has the option to operate with only brightness temperature or associating this scheme with precipitation features. The selection criteria and filters for considering or not a MCS can be modified. The parameterization in this notebook was established from an extensive literature review, which can be consulted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The detection of the MCS (regions) is performed using these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At any time pixel, find all where temperature brightness `Tb` $\\le 225 K$ and trace an approximate region, with the convex hull, according to a binary structure where the pixels that satisfy the described condition are equal to $1$ and those that do not are equal to $0$.\n",
    "2. Transform from geographic to plane coordinates the pixels and compute an approximate area of those regions traced. \n",
    "3. Discard all regions whose area is $\\le 2000 km^2$.\n",
    "4. Estimate the average, minimum and maximum temperature brightness of those regions.\n",
    "5. At any time pixel, find all where precipitation `P` $\\ge 2 mm \\times {h^{-1}}$ and discard pixels that do not match with the regions estimated in that time step.\n",
    "6. Estimate an approximate area of those precipitation pixels, that satisfy the previous condition and that are contained in the regions.\n",
    "7. Estimate the average and maximum precipitation for each region whose area is $\\ge 500 km^2$. The algorithm has the option of discard those regions whose precipitaion area is $\\le 500 km^2$, but in this case those regions are going to be part of the possible tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The tracks are performed using these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, assume we have detected $n$ MSC at time $t$, and $m$ MSC at time $t+1$. There are theoretically $n \\times m$ possible associations to link these two groups of MCS. Of cause not all of them are meaningful. The rules that are applied in the association process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **overlapping priority** principle: for any MCS at time $t$, the MCS with the highest percentage of overlap at time $t+1$ \"wins\" and is associated with it. \n",
    "2. The MCS with the lowest percentage of overlap at time $t+1$ could form a track on their own, and waits to be associated in the next iteration between $t+1$ and $t+2$.\n",
    "3. No merging or splitting is allowed, any MCS at time $t$ can only be linked to one MCS at time $t+1$, similarly, any MCS at time $t+1$ can only be linked to one MCS at time $t$.\n",
    "4. All tracks that do not get updated during the $t$ - $t+1$ process terminates. This assumes that no gap in the track is allowed. \n",
    "5. Discard all tracks whose total duration is $\\le 4 h$. The algorithm has the option for filtering the tracks with a specific minimun duration or not.\n",
    "\n",
